# ML-clustering-kl-properties-vs-venues
 In this project we will compare different neighborhoods of Kuala Lumpur based on property prices and venues

#Introduction/Business Problem
In this project we will compare different neighborhoods of the KL city based on property prices, types and venues around that neighborhood using machine learning clustering algorithms.

There are many reasons people relocate within city boundaries, e.g. getting a new job offer, kids moving to different school or moving away from bad neighborhood etc. This project will help such people to compare different neughborhoods of Kuala Lumpur city in terms of property types, prices, size and most importantly the venues around specific neighborhood.

# Dataset
We will use the dataset created by Jan S available on Kaggle.

This dataset contains thousands of property listings scraped from iproperty.com for every neighborhood of Kuala Lumpurt city.

For venues around each neighborhood we will gather data from Foursquare.com
